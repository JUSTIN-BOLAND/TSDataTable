# TSDataTable

**TSDataTable** is a simple elegant data table publishing tool for Google Sheets &amp; Sites.  See the [blog post](https://medium.com/@techstreams/tsdatatable-simple-elegant-data-tables-for-google-sheets-sites-28ccd35385d0).


**TSDataTable** employs [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) inside a [(Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to retrieve data from the *first sheet*, filter the data based on hidden rows and columns, cache the data to speed subsequent views and display data in a nicely formatted, paginated and searchable data table. 

**TSDataTable** display options are configurable and the resulting site can be standalone or embedded in Google Sites.

**TSDataTable** is intended for data table publishing within a [G Suite for Business](https://gsuite.google.com/solutions/) or [G Suite for Education](https://edu.google.com/products/gsuite-for-education) domain.
